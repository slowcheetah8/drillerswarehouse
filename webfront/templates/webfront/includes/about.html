			<p>Our objective for Drillers Warehouse is to provide a range of goods and commodities into the drilling industry focusing initially on the blast hole market. We aim to stock a full range of products.</p>
			<p>Based on a typical “Warehouse” concept, Driller Warehouse Pty Ltd intends is to provide customers a full range of consumable, supplied by all drill consumable manufacturing companies, from a central source. This will allow all companies to market their products through Drillers Warehouse at their selling price with a predetermined commission built in for Drillers Warehouse.</p>
			<p>Drillers Warehouse will actively market all products through electronic media, monthly flyers and face to face contact with the customer. Through this advertising, special promotions will be included and communicated to the market in general. We will also offer the customers technical support and advice as specified by the manufacturer.</p>
			<p>Drillers Warehouse will endeavour to be registered as a vendor at all the major mining houses and contractors, where buyers and procurement department can source all their drilling consumable requirements from one outlet.</p>
			<p>Drillers Warehouse has developed a trade mark called “DRILLERS CHOICE”, with the aim to allow manufactures to sell at special prices or move products anonymously should the need arise.</p>
			<p>Drillers Warehouse are currently preparing our web site which we expect will be up and running within the next four weeks. All product listed on the web page will display the products with the manufactures Logos, product specifications and a Recommended Retail Price (RRT). The RRT price will be based on the highest market prices of a product, but final pricing (cost to customer) will be determined by the manufacture as communicated to Drillers Warehouse by the manufacturer based on their customer discount structure and special agreements.</p>
			<p>We trust that this new concept will be supported by the manufactures and will boost their sales in existing markets and regions that a currently not been covered.</p>
			<p>Drillers Warehouse invites the manufacturer to comment on the concept and assist us in developing this idea further.</p>
